the perceptron learning is still used widely today for tasks with enormous feature vectors that contain many millions of features.

decision unit of perceptron is binary threshold neurons.
`z=b+sum(x_i*w_i)`
`y=1 if z>0, otherwise y=0`


* caveat:
if is gurantee to find a set of weights that get the right answer for all the training cases `if any such set exists`
